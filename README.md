MATLAB code for the paper "Inference and forecasting for continuous time integer-valued trawl processes and their use in financial economics" by Bennedsen, Lunde, Shephard, and Veraart (2021).

Note that the code relies on a number of C++ functions, which must be compiled into .mex format. Hence, to run the code, it is necessary that a .mex-compiler be installed beforehand. Once a .mex-compiler is installed, the .mex files will be compiled automatically when running the attached code.
